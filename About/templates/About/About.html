     <p>I am an Estonian combined arts researcher from Tartu, Estonia. An alumni from ArtScience of Art Academy in the Hague http://www.interfaculty.nl/2016/05/

​My work involves theoretical and practical exploration of human perception, embodiment visualization, and conceptual choreography. The elements that I use are minimalism, abstraction, extraction, visual illustration. My work is exhibited in the form of an installation. 

The best single world to describe my artistic research for the past 7 years would be connections. In my BA degree I started with “virtual theatre” where I researched virtual platforms for performance artists and why would that have a lower quality effect than exhibiting one's performance in a real theatre space. With my M.Mus. degree I researched the connection between humans and inanimate objects to learn about anthropomorphic tendencies and whether they apply to our efforts in perfecting machinery to simulate humans. I made an installation called “MACHINE MACHINE” where I observed how a depth camera would perceive a performer with it’s own “mechanical eye”. For learning vision I went to the Waag Society laboratory in Amsterdam to collaborate with biologists and dissect a cow eyeball to learn how retina and lens work. As a result I built a mechanical replica eye, which included a light sensor for the retina, a vibrating sensor for the reflex, a glass lens, darker walls, and external light to manipulate it.

As a part of my research into connection I also developed protection from unwanted attention. I have made a series of garments that incorporate a Faraday Cage, to protect from data theft in public spaces.

In my new research I am going to be studying the issue of missing persons reported by police, and under/overpolicing of society in general- for example, are CCTV cameras needed or is there any other solution that would prevent one or another group of people disconnecting from society and would it ever be possible to prevent data abuse and intrusion.
 



Artist Statement

I track the patterns. And sometimes I get them logically wrong. But art forgives me. </p>
